# Stacks
Various Programs demonstrating the programming logic of Stacks using Pointers.
<br><br>

### Stack_merger.c
This Program prompts a user to enter two lists of numeral values which are stored in separate stacks.  The program will then order the values, and merge the lists together using C's malloc function.<br>

### Stack_palindrome_checker.c
Program which determines if a user entered word is a palindrome, by pushing the characters into a stack and analysing them.<br>

### Stack_recursive_print.c
This Program will iterate through a stack until reaching the final link, before recursively printing each value until all values are popped off the stack.<br>

### Stack_recursive_search.c
Similar to recursive_print.c, this Program will iterate through a Stack, and return the first value matching the user's search input.<br>

### Stack_reverser.c
Pushes a user entered sentence of characters onto a stack, before pushing them out (reversing the order).

### Instructions:
Navigate to the Project directory using Terminal or preferred compiler and type:<br> 
``` gcc –o ProgramName ProgramName ``` to build.  
Next, run the executable file that is created.
